                    <p class="article-intro">
                        With heavy rain causing flooding around the UK, it's important we know how to keep our

Flood water can contain many harmful toxins including human and livestock waste, debris, rodents, or even downed power lines. "Extreme weather of all kinds can be distressing for dogs. Signs to look out for include pacing around the home, excessive barking, or trying to run and hide," says the Dogs' Trust. "There are steps owners can take to comfort their dogs and help them cope if they are becoming anxious. If you're worried about the weather, keep your dog indoors as much as possible."
                        <br />
                        Grab your raincoat and take a look at the <a href="https://www.dogstrust.org.uk/" target="_blank">Dog's Trust</a> advice below before you head out:

                    <ol class="tips-list">
                        <li>Avoid walking in any flooded areas, as the water could be contaminated.</li>
                        <li>Consider heading out at a different time to avoid heavy rain.</li>
                        <li>If you can head out safely, always keep your dog on a lead so they can't run off and get into difficulties.</li>
                        <li>Keep your pet out of the water as it could contain toxic chemicals. While it's tempting for them to run through the water, keep them occupied with other treats.</li>
                        <li>If the storm is disrupting your dog's exercise routine, keep them active in the home by creating a toy filled with food.</li>
                        <li>Make sure your dogs wear a hi-vis jacket or <a href="https://www.countryliving.com/uk/wildlife/pets/g35012308/light-up-dog-collar/" target="_blank">reflective collar</a> to help them stay safe.</li>
                        <li>If you are near an area that may flood, be aware that flood water could contain raw sewage.</li>
                        <li>Bathe them if you have been out on a walk, as the water toxins could remain on their coat if not bathed properly.</li>

                    <ul class="additional-tips">
                        <li>Ensure they have a safe place to play in the <a href="https://www.countryliving.com/uk/homes-interiors/gardens/a20728042/best-gardening-apps-download-garden/" target="_blank">garden</a> if they need to head outdoors.</li>
                        <li>Make sure your dog is microchipped, the contact details are up to date, and your dog is wearing a collar and an ID tag whilst out walking, so if they do get lost, they can be reunited with you.</li>
                        <li>Keep an eye on older dogs as cold, damp weather might make them feel a little stiffer than usual.</li>
                        <li>Never go out if your dog is feeling anxious about the weather. Some signs they are feeling unsettled include shaking, not being excited by walks or hiding. The Dogs' Trust advise: "Any dog showing behaviour change should have a vet check to rule out any underlying medical conditions or sources of pain."</li>
                        <li>Finally, always talk to your vet if you have any concerns about your dog's health in extreme weather. They will be able to provide you with expert help.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By following these tips, you can ensure a safer and more enjoyable walking experience for your dog, even in rainy or flood-prone conditions. Stay safe and keep your furry friend protected!</p>
