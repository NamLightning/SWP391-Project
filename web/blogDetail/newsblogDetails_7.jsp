                    <p class="article-intro">
                        The internet has been left in tears as they discover the reason behind a rescue dog's obsession with white cars in a viral TikTok video.

                        At the start of the clip, which has 1.1 million views, Harvey, the pit bull, can be seen wagging his tail while he laps up the love from a woman in the driver's seat of her white vehicle.

                        The onscreen text explains that the owner lived with her mom when she first adopted Harvey, and he also became "very attached" to her. The owner says she and Harvey would run into her mom during his walks, and she would always "stop and say hi to him."
                    </p>
                    <p>But, a few months ago, the daughter moved and her dog continued to get excited whenever he saw a white car as he thought it was his grandma. However, it never was, according to the owner, but she recorded the moment her mom finally pulled up and Harvey's reaction.

                        In the footage titled "grandma's car," the dog can be seen excitedly wagging his tail as the white car parks before enjoying head strokes and cuddles from his grandma.</p>

                    <p> Foreman said: "A dog's medium-term memory is limited, however. 
                        For example, if a dog goes to the toilet on the carpet and an owner finds it a couple of hours later and tells the dog off, the animal will not associate being told off with having been to the toilet in an inappropriate place. They will therefore not learn from the experience. They will not understand why they are being told off, and may actually develop fearful behavior from the confrontation instead.</p>

                    <p>"Equally, if they eat something they are not supposed to (for example, chocolate or grapes) and they are taken to the vets to be made to be sick to stop toxicity from occurring, they will not associate eating the food with being sick, and are still likely to eat it again in the future," added Foreman.<p>
